    with open(file_name, "w") as file:
        file.write(f"<accession_number>{accession_range}</accession_number>")
This code creates a list of tuples, each containing the name of the file, the first accession number, and the last accession number. It then iterates over the list, creating a file for each accession number range and writing the range to the file as a string within the <accession_number> tags.

you removed the dashes is columns 2 and 3 e.g. 98.2716  should be 98-2716

    with open(file_name, "w") as file:
        file.write(f"<accession_number>{accession_range}</accession_number>")
I apologize for the mistake on my previous response. In the above code, I've kept the dashes in columns 2 and 3 for accession numbers. and the code will create a file for each accession number range with the correct format and write the range to the file as a string within the <accession_number> tags.

drop column 1 in the table

    with open(file_name, "w") as file:
        file.write(f"<accession_number>{accession_range}</accession_number>")
In this code, I removed the first column from the accession_numbers list, and in the for loop, I used the first element of the tuple as the file name, and the first and second elements of the tuple as the accession range. This will create a file for each accession number range with the correct format and write the range to the file as a string within the <accession_number> tags

compute the accession numbers between columns 1 and 2 and output to  the screen

    accession_numbers_range = [f"{str(start)[:2]}-{str(i).zfill(4)}" for i in range(start, end+1)]
    print(accession_numbers_range)
This code will iterate through the list of accession number tuples, and for each tuple, it will remove the dash from the start and end accession numbers, converts them to integer and assigns them to start and end.
Then it creates a list comprehension that iterates through a range from start to end (inclusive) and formats the number with leading zero, and adds dashes in the second and third positions and assigns the list to accession_numbers_range. Finally, it prints the list on the screen.

Note that this code doesn't create the files, it just prints the accession numbers on the screen.




JU
The accession numbers should be as shown in the original list.  For example  98-982716 is incorrect. It should be 98-2716.

    print(accession_numbers_range)
I apologize for misunderstanding your requirements. The above code iterates through the list of accession number tuples, and for each tuple, it will remove the leading number by using split function on '-' and get the second element of the tuple which is the accession number and converts them to integer and assigns them to start and end.
Then it creates a list comprehension that iterates through a range from start to end (inclusive) and formats the number with leading zero, and adds dashes in the second and third positions and assigns the list to accession_numbers_range. Finally, it prints the list on the screen.




JU
that's not what I'm looking for.    I need accession numbers between "98-2716" and "98-2719  which would be 98-2717 and 98-22718.  repeat this process through the list
I apologize for the confusion. Here's the updated code that will generate the accession numbers between the start and end of each tuple in the list:

    accession_numbers_range = [f"{str(x)[:2]}-{str(x).zfill(4)[2:]}" for x in range(start+1, end)]
    print(accession_numbers_range)
This code iterates through the list of accession number tuples, and for each tuple, it will remove the leading number by using split function on '-' and get the second element of the tuple which is the accession number and converts them to integer and assigns them to start and end.
Then it creates a list comprehension that iterates through a range from start+1 to end-1 (inclusive) and formats the number with leading zero, and adds dashes in the second and third positions and assigns the list to accession_numbers_range. Finally, it prints the list on the screen.




JU
['27-17', '27-18'] should be  ['98-2717' ,' 98-2718] and so on for the entire list
I apologize for the mistake, here is the correct code that will generate the accession numbers in the desired format:

ChatGPT
accession_numbers = [

for accession_number in accession_numbers:
    prefix = accession_number[0].split("-")[0]
    start, end = [int(x.split("-")[1]) for x in accession_number]
    accession_numbers_range = [f"{prefix}-{str(x).zfill(4)}" for x in range(start+1, end)]
    print(accession_numbers_range)
This code iterates through the list of accession number tuples, and for each tuple, it will get the first part of accession number which is the prefix and assigns it to prefix variable, then it will remove the leading number by using split function on '-' and get the second element of the tuple which is the accession number and converts them to integer and assigns them to start and end.
Then it creates a list comprehension that iterates through a range from start+1 to end-1 (inclusive) and adds prefix to the number and assigns the list to accession_numbers_range. Finally, it prints the list on the screen.

    else:
        accession_numbers_range = [f"{prefix}-{str(x).zfill(4)}" for x in range(start+1, end)]
    print(accession_numbers_range)

This code iterates through the list of accession number tuples, and for each tuple, it will get the first part of accession number which is the prefix and assigns it to prefix variable, then it will remove the leading number by using split function on '-' and get the second element of the tuple which is the accession number and converts them to integer and assigns them to start and end.
Then it check if the end value is a three digit number , if it is, it will create a list comprehension that iterates through a range from start+1 to end-1 (inclusive) and add prefix to the number without leading zero and assigns the list to accession_numbers_range. If the end value is not a three digit number, it will add leading zero to the number, and assigns the list to accession_numbers_range. Finally, it prints the list on the screen.
